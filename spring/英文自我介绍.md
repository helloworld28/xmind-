# 英文自我介绍





 Good morning everyone. I am Qinyujun And you can call me Jim ,it’s my English name. 

I have 6 years of experience in software development and I  Worked in listed companies and startups，

 According to the JD, it seems you are looking for senior Java developer. And I am also a senior Java developer in Kiktech company. 

 As far as I can understand from the JD, this job requires 3 major parts

the first part is having experience with Java 8, micro-services and web application development

and the second part is having Experience with CI or CD pipeline 

the third and most important part is having Strong analytical, design and problem solving skills

And in current  company, my position is  senior software engineer and my  major  responsibility  includes 3 parts

the first Part is taking charge of  project framework construction and core function development.

the second Part is   guiding  junior engineers to complete tasks with high quality.

the third part is Writing project related technical documents.

The most recent development project is the wms and agv scheduling system.

wms uses a microservices distributed architecture, which is built using springboot and sprind cloud.

The AGV scheduling system is implemented using the Akka reactor framework, which uses spring boot.

Jkens is used in our project development for continuous integration. When the code is submitted, it will be automatically built into the test environment and then run automatic testing.

The projects are developed based on Java 8. Then I like the features of Java 8, such as stream, lamda, optional.

This is all what I'm currently doing and I guess it should be close to what you require. 	

Thanks.

最近的开发项目有wms and agv 调度系统。

wms 用到了微服务分布式架构，它是使用了springboot 与sprind Cloud 来搭建的。

AGV 调度系统是使用Akka reactor框架来实现的，它用到spring boot。

项目开发中都有用到Jkens 来持续集成，提交代码，会自动构建到测试环境，然后跑自动测试。

项目都是基于java 8来开发的，然后我很喜欢java 8的特性，如stream, lamda, optional。
